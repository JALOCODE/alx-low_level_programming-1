C - more functions, more nested loops

0 - write a function that checks for upper case character.

1 - write a function that checks for a digit(0 - 9).

2 - write a function that multiplies two integers.

3 - write a function that prints the numbers, from 0 - 9, followed by a new line.

4 - write a function that prints the numbers, from 0 - 9. followed by a new line.

5 - write a function that prints ten times the number, from 0 - 14, followed by a new line.

6 - write a function that draws a straight line in the terminal.

7 - write a function that draws a diagonal line on the terminal.

8 - write a function that prints a square, followed by a new line.

9 - Fizz-Buzz - write a program that prints the numbers from 1 - 100, followed by a new line, but for multiples of three print Fizz: the number and for multiples of five print Buzz. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print FizzBuzz.
